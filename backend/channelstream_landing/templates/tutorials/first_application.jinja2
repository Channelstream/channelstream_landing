## First Application

As mentioned in introduction page to connect browser to websocket server you need to do following steps:


* Send a JSON request to connect endpoint of API, telling the server that user wants to connect to a channel called "/tutorial" - this is handled by your application - here is where authentication and authorization happens
* Grab the response from the server - it will contain current state of user (it is created if user was connecting for the first time), state of channels that user connected to, and a connection UUID.
* Return the connection UUID back to browser client
* Client uses UUID to connect to a websocket or long polling endpoint

### Step 1: Initialize javascript client

    :::javascript

    import {ChannelStreamConnection} from '@channelstream/channelstream';
    let connection = new ChannelStreamConnection();
    // this points to your application view
    connection.connectUrl = '/connect';
    connection.messageUrl = '/message';
    // this points to channelstream
    connection.websocketUrl = 'ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws';
    connection.longPollUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/listen';

    connection.listenMessageCallback = (messages) => {
        for (let message of messages) {
            console.log('channelstream message', message);
            // Do something on message received
        }
    };
    // optional
    connection.listenOpenedCallback = () => {
        // Do something on websocket opened
    };
    // this will try to obtain connection UUID from `connectUrl` endpoint of your WEB application via XHR call
    // and then use it to make websocket connection
    connection.connect();

{% endfilter %}

### Step 2: Implement /connect endpoint in your application

We need to tell the server that user "someuser" connects to "/tutorial" channel.

Channelstream requires all API calls to be signed with a shared secret, the default implementation used is
`TimestampSigner` from `itsdangerous` package.

    :::python
    import requests
    from itsdangerous import TimestampSigner

    # create auth header for backend request
    signer = TimestampSigner("secret")
    sig_for_server = signer.sign("channelstream")
    secret_headers = {
        "x-channelstream-secret": sig_for_server,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    # connect user
    payload = {
        "username": "someuser",
        "channels": ["/tutorial-1"]
    }
    response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect", data=json.dumps(payload), headers=secret_headers)
    response.json() # contains connection UUID

{% endfilter %}

<channelstream-landing-demo requestMethod="post" requestEndpoint="/connect"
                            relayUrl="{{ request.route_url('demo_payload_relay') }}">
    <p slot="header">Simulate the /connect API call to the server</p>
    <div slot="description">Notice how "channels_info" get updated when you subscribe new users/create new channels.
    If no actual websocket/long-polling connections are made by the clients those objects will get garbage collected.</div>
    <pre>
        {
            "username": "someuser",
            "channels": ["/tutorial-1"]
        }
    </pre>
</channelstream-landing-demo>

{% filter markdown %}

### Step 3: Send message to users listening on /tutorial-1 channel

    :::python
    import requests
    from itsdangerous import TimestampSigner

    # create auth header for backend request
    signer = TimestampSigner("secret")
    sig_for_server = signer.sign("channelstream")
    secret_headers = {
        "x-channelstream-secret": sig_for_server,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    # send messages
    payload = [
        {
            "user": "system",
            "channel": "/tutorial-1",
            "message": {
                "text": "This can serve as notification",
                "level": "warning"
            }
        }
    ]
    response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/connect", data=json.dumps(payload), headers=secret_headers)

{% endfilter %}

    <channelstream-landing-demo requestMethod="post" requestEndpoint="/message"
                                relayUrl="{{ request.route_url('demo_payload_relay') }}">
        <p slot="header"Send the message via /message API call to the server</p>
        <div slot="description">If you open up index page you will see that the connection there did not receive
            the message sent here - this is because they are subscribed to different channels and this is determined
            securely on your application side. However if you open this page in multiple windows/browsers you will
            see everyone subscribed to this channel will receive the message.</div>
        <pre>
        [
            {
                "user": "system",
                "channel": "/tutorial-1",
                "message": {
                    "text": "This can serve as notification",
                    "level": "warning"
                }
            }
        ]
        </pre>
    </channelstream-landing-demo>

<script type="module">
    import {DocsFirstAppView} from "{{ request.static_url('channelstream_landing:static_bundled/bundle-main.js') }}";
    DocsFirstAppView({
        connectUrl: '{{ request.route_url('connect') }}',
        messageUrl: '{{ request.route_url('message') }}',
        websocketUrl: '{{ request.route_url('channelstream_ws_url') }}',
        longPollUrl: '{{ request.route_url('channelstream_public_url') }}listen'
    });
